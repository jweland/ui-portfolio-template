# Freeform

When reading this section, I was inspired by the first portion of the reading that spoke about the personalities of color. While I did believe that each color held a unique sort of vibe, I never considered it as the color having a personality which is an interesting concept. Because of this, I decided to do a small experiment of my own. Since I was sitting downstairs in my Greek house while doing this reading, I decided to ask girls who walked by what their favorite color was. When they answered, I then read of the personality of the color and asked them how well it matched their perception of their own personality. Surprisingly enough, there was a correlation between the two. The first girl I asked was very bubbly and energetic. When I asked her the question, she stated that her favorite color was red. I read to her that red is “easily bored” and “passionate about life.” She responded, “OMG, that is totally me; it makes so much sense.” I found this a very amusing discovery. When I went to self-reflect on what my favorite color is, my mind instantly jumped to blue. Then I re-read the blue description, and it made sense to me. I do value “a sense of calm and order in your life.” Even further down when it made the distinction between a lighter blue and a navy, I completely agreed. I just thought this was a very cool discovery and wanted to share the mini experiment that I had conducted.
