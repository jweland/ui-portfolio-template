# Approximate Analogy

<b>"Emotion in storytelling is to a presentation as seasoning is to a meal."</b>
Just as seasoning enhances the taste of a dish, making it more enjoyable and memorable, emotion through storytelling enriches a presentation. A story adds depth, humanizing the content, which helps the audience connect on a personal level. Without seasoning, a meal can taste bland and boring. Similarly, a presentation without emotional resonance can feel fake which makes it less impactful to the viewer. Emotion keeps the audience engaged, making the key points more relatable and memorable. This is important to remember in my career as I present meaningful projects. In order to have my listeners connect and engage with what I am saying, I need to add emotion and dramatics.
