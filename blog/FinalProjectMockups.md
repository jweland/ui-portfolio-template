<b>Color Scheme:</b>
The color scheme is a monochrome blue. The tones are contrasting as well with darker headers and lighter boxes for areas with more information

<b>Font:</b> The font throughout the design is Sofia Sans. I was considering switching sub-headers and text to a plain sans but I believe the font is basic enough to not need to distinguish
