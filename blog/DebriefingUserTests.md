<b>Iteration</b>

I chose the word "Iteration" because the reading emphasizes the importance of conducting multiple rounds of testing with small groups of users rather than one large group. This concept is crucial in design because the iterative process allows you to find and address issues progressively. Rather than testing a large group in one round, smaller groups (typically three users) allow for quick testing, fixing, and retesting cycles, which ensures that more problems can be identified and resolved in subsequent rounds. In my career, remembering to iterate will help me focus on continuous improvement rather than trying to perfect everything in one go, making it more manageable and effective. In addition, iteration can help me dive deeper into situations and problems and find new and creative solutions.
