<b>Personality</b>

The word I chose was ‘personality’ because that is essentially what you want to convey in your UI portfolio. When an employee goes to see your project, they are also seeing your own style and that is very important to show. If you have more of a modern and clean look, you are going to seek a different company then possibly a more vibrant and expressive portfolio. This is important because an employer wants to see who you are and what your vibe is. When considering my own personality I think I will need to create a clean, light, and airy looking portfolio because that is the aura I want to convey.
