# ApproximateAnalogy

This reading discussed a lot of the importance of design features and more specifically the user of space. The author stated that white space is very important in design and can really elevate the appearance of an interface. I made an analogy that white space is to design as breaks are to a schedule. White space can elevate a design because by having white space, a viewer can really home in on the details, purpose, or message of the design. I compared the white space to a break in my schedule. When creating my schedule for a day, I could pack it to the max, doing task after task and chore after chore. While it may seem efficient at first, upon closer inspection, this is a flawed approach because without a break, I become less productive due to tiredness. Just like white space in a design, you need breaks in a schedule to give time to really focus on the important aspects and give your full effort and attention. Even though it doesnâ€™t seem packed or full, it is more successful because you are able to put all your energy and focus into a smaller number of tasks or a smaller portion of the overall design.
