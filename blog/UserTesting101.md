<b>Uniqueness</b>

The word I chose for this reading passage was “uniqueness” because when designing a web page, it is crucial to recognize there is not standard user. Each person who iterates with your website will have different goals and values they want communicated through the application. A key problem in web design is that web designers, developers, and other stakeholders tend to project their preferences onto users, assuming that most users share their opinions. After reading this passage and reflecting, I realized that this may apply to me as well. Sometimes I believe my idea is the best because it is most applicable to my own life, not considering how others have their own experiences and outlook. This is something important to remember in my own career when I am working on teams. Recognizing the differences between people in a group can help to make more productive conversations and overall decisions.
