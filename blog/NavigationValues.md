Self-Awareness
	This reading focused on how an individual can find their values and how that can help improve the relationships of a team. I chose the word “self-awareness” because I think people struggle with being honest with themselves and the values that truly represent them. While this is a hard task to do, it is vital for the success of a team. When you are aware of your own strengths and values, you can better align yourself with your own work and furthermore the work of the team. I think a lot of conflict can arise when people have contrasting viewpoints on a matter or place different significances on a topic. By understanding why you do something the way you do or why you can about one aspect more than another, it allows yourself and the team to comprehend the actions you may take and then together, as a group, make progress towards the goal at hand.
