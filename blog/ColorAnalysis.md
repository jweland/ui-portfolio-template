Color Study: Nike

<b>Color Scheme Analysis:</b> Nike’s website utilizes an achromatic color scheme meaning that the use only black, gray and white in their design. The only pop of color found on the website is from the picture on the bottom two thirds of the screen. Within this picture, there is an even brighter pop of orange on the shoe, which also conveniently displays Nike’s logo. The achromatic color scheme gives the website a subtle, modern feel to it. I believe that Nike designed the page like to really emphasis and give attention to the picture of the shoe. They want users to focus on the product they are trying to sell and not the different tabs and navigational features of the website. I believe this is a very effective strategy because my eye is immediately drawn to the picture and the shoe. Even if I was going on the website to look for something specific, I am now also interested in looking into this shoe. The basic layout makes it simple for me to navigate to whatever I am searching for, reducing the need for color emphasizes on tabs and bars.
Creating Unique Color Schemes
 
<b>Color Scheme Analysis #1 Remake:</b> For the first color scheme analysis, I changed the scheme to fit an analogous color scheme which is any three consecutive shades on a color wheel. In this case, I used orange, yellow-orange, and yellow as the three shades. I specifically chose this to match with the orange tab on the shoe. Unfortunately, the orange color on the shoe is brighter so it doesn’t exactly match but the overall color range is similar. The mood of this pattern is bright and energetic. It gives the feel of warm and bright but not necessarily overpowering. I think the designer would hope for the user to feel ready to take on the day with a new pair of shoes or other Nike apparel.


 
<b>Color Scheme Analysis #2 Remake:</b> For the first color scheme analysis, I changed the scheme to fit a clash color scheme which mixing a color with the color to the left or right of its complement on the color wheel. In this case, the colors I mixed were green and purple. The feel of this design is disorganized. The color clash is not very soft on the eyes and distracts from anything else on the screen. In addition, purple with black text is not the easiest to read. The mood given off is hectic and does not draw attention to the product that Nike is trying to promote.


 
<b>Color Scheme Analysis #3 Remake:</b> For the first color scheme analysis, I changed the scheme to fit a monochrome color scheme which is using different shades of the same color. For the monochrome color, I chose to use blue because I thought it could give off a cool vibe that it seems like Nike strives the have. I believe that this color scheme does effectively give off a chill vibe because of the blue and is not too overwhelming. A monochrome scheme allows for the colors to not be too contrasting and as a result lets the user focus on other details such as the picture. In addition, monochrome and achromatic are similar in terms of effect/lay out so it makes sense that this design flows well with the overall design and feel of the website.

 
<b>Color Scheme Analysis #4 Remake:</b> For the first color scheme analysis, I changed the scheme to fit a neutral color scheme which uses neutral shades and tone. It is somewhat comparative to a monochrome look as well. I decided to create a look using these tones because I thought similarly to the original design, it could give a sleek and modern look. The user would feel down to earth but also have a calming presence. This color scheme would go well with a variety of pics meaning Nike could update their website frequently. In addition, the color scheme fits well into the background and your eye is still draw to the picture and focal point of the website. It allows users to carry on with their searching and shopping experience and not get distracted by the design of the website.

<b>Effectiveness:</b>
Out of all the color scheme remakes, I would rank them on effectiveness in the following order with the first being the most effective: 4, 3, 1, 2. For Nike’s website, the most effective experience would have the picture be the focal point of the website while having a color scheme that does not draw away from the navigability of the website and I believe 4 best does this. The neutral scheme is very similar to the original in the fact that they both give a modern appeal that does not take away from the website and rather complements it. While 3 and 1 both had acceptable schemes, they still took away too much attention from the picture and the website. 2 was a very bad design and would not give the user a very enjoyable experience at all. The calming tone of the neutral color scheme would also give shoppers a more laid back and lighter experience with a modern appearance rather than something flashy that including more colors would have. While I believe that the original is still the best design, I don’t think Nike could go wrong with a color scheme similar to 4.
