# Freeform

This reading focused primarily on colors and the different ways they can be organized. They can be organized into primary and secondary, hot and cold, light and dark, and so many more. Because of the focus on the different grouping of colors and how they can go together, I decided for this reading to do an observational by looking around my room at Chi Omega and finding different color schemes. A lot of my decor is monochromatic in a pink color scheme. One poster contains a pink gradient, and another contains a pink picture with pink text and outlines. When I look at my computer screen, the default Microsoft background utilizes secondary colors in a bubbly pattern. These are very saturated colors and make the screen really pop. One sticker that I have sitting next to my computer uses all tertiary colors with a bright red background. The raspberry and lime sparkling water I am drink right now uses a pink and green complementary scheme that makes the colors really pop. I found it very cool to look around my room and see the different color schemes in use and it help me to generate ideas about how I can utilize different color combinations.
