Providing effective feedback is important in the growth, creativity, and collaboration of a team. Feedback is not about pointing out what went wrong. It's about building a support system, offering clarity, and encouraging progress. Understanding how to give and receive feedback is a skill that significantly impacts both the quality of design work and professional development. This article helped me to understand how feedback can impact the work I do. By both giving and receiving feedback in a more positive and productive manner, I am improving the quality of my own work and the work of team members or classmates. Sometimes in the past it has been hard for me to accept feedback because it has felt like a personal attack when I need to realize people are just trying to help me as best as they can.
